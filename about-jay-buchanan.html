<ul>
<li>NASM Certified Personal Trainer&nbsp;</li>
<li>CPR/AED Certified through the American Heart Association</li>
<li>Bachelor of Science in Exercise and Sport Sciences</li>
<li>Master of Science in Exercise and Sport Sciences with an emphasis in Sport Management</li>
<li>Over 10 years experience as a certified personal trainer</li>
<li>Worked as a strength and conditioning coach for 2 years while earning a Master's degree</li>
<li>Have the freedom to train anybody, anytime, anywhere</li>
<li>To let you know more about me; I'm from Arlington, Texas. &nbsp;I attended Trinity Valley School for high school. &nbsp;TVS is a very small college prep school. &nbsp;With the small numbers we didn't have cuts or off season. &nbsp;Therefore I was able to play many different varsity level sports even as a freshman. &nbsp;That experience paid off HUGE because when I was a strength coach in college I was able to help out with many different sports. &nbsp;I attended Texas Tech University for my undergraduate and graduate degrees. I also worked for a professional hockey team while in Lubbock. &nbsp;I did in game stats and public address for the Lubbock Cotton Kings. &nbsp;After college I lived in Denver working as an announcer for Denver University and the University of Colorado.</li>
<li>To me, there is nothing more rewarding than seeing people achieve their fitness goals. &nbsp;It's amazing to see the weight drop and energy re-emerge, and to have a clients knee or lower back pain disappear, but the biggest accomplishment I experience as a trainer is to see my clients able to truly get more out of life because they accomplished something great and regained control of their life.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The biggest reason I have for wanting to change peoples lives through fitness is the fact that I personally know what it's like to feel out of place, or different because of being over weight. &nbsp;I was a chubby KID in the late 80's eating salads and drinking Diet Coke while all my friends were eating McDonald's and drinking anything with sugar in it. &nbsp;I personally know what it's like to think there's no hope, and then pull a complete 180 and see the light. &nbsp;</li>
<li>I love being a personal trainer and don't see myself doing anything else, but eventually I'd like to own my own gym and be my own boss. &nbsp;I would like it to be pretty small. &nbsp;Just like the gym I mostly train out of now.</li>
<li>My style of training involves a couple of different methods depending on what your goals are and what your fitness level is. &nbsp;Since most people are in it to burn fat, I use more HITT and Functional Training than anything else. &nbsp;It is designed to increase the heart rate and keep it in the "fat burning" zone. &nbsp;While in the fat burning zone we do various strength training exercises. &nbsp;That way we are burning fat and sculpting the body at the same time. &nbsp;once your heart rate is in the fat burning zone, it will spike and drop in intervals, but stay above about 125 beats per minute. &nbsp;HIIT stands for High Intensity Interval Training. &nbsp;Functional training means reproducing movements your body performs on a daily basis without the use of a machine. &nbsp;Such as your basic push, pull, squat, and lunge, but with no machine. &nbsp;We do this with the use of&nbsp;kettle bells, resistance bands,&nbsp;dumbbells, stability balls, and multiple exercises that can be performed with the body alone. &nbsp;Another style of training that I tend to utilize with my new clients that are more&nbsp;de conditioned&nbsp;or have a knee, ankle, or hip injury is unstable training. &nbsp;The theme here is to burn fat by properly utilizing as many major muscle groups as possible especially the core. &nbsp;The core basically consists of the lower back, abs, and obliques. &nbsp;The more muscles being used, the more calories are being burned. &nbsp;The idea is to challenge a persons&nbsp;stabilization&nbsp;or&nbsp;balance&nbsp;on just about every exercise. &nbsp;To properly balance, or&nbsp;stabilize&nbsp;one's self, the core must be utilized. &nbsp;In this style of training we use a lot of stability ball, balance board,&nbsp;air-ex&nbsp;pad, and single leg exercises. There is also a large emphasis on the&nbsp;stabilizers&nbsp;around the knee, hip, and ankle. &nbsp;Balance exercises are a common theme and are ideal for&nbsp;rehabbing&nbsp;knee, hip, and ankle injuries.</li>
<li>When I get a new client the first thing we talk about is his or her goals. &nbsp;This determines exactly what we will emphasize on. &nbsp;After I know what to focus on, we will do a Body Fat Analysis. &nbsp;This determines what percentage of your total body weight is fat. &nbsp;I use calipers to measure this, and we can have it done every month to measure your progress. &nbsp;I'm looking for steady progress, which means a decrease in a half to a whole percent per month, or a loss of 1 to 2 pounds per week. &nbsp;After new year's I'll have electronic body fat analysis call bioelectrical&nbsp;impedance. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
